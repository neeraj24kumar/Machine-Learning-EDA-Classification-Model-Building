# Machine-Learning-EDA-Classification-Model-Building
To predict the outcomes of drug types that might be suitable for patients and to build and evaluate the accuracy of different classification models.

# About Dataset
It is a dataset referred from kaggle by Ibrahim Bahbah named drug200. The dataset contains dataset contains information about drug classification based on patient general information and its diagnosis. 
- Dataset Link:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ibrahimbahbah/drug200

# Goal
In order to predict the outcome of the drug types that might be suitable for the patient and to build and evaluate the accuracy of different classification models such as Logistic Regression, K Neighbors, SVM, Decision Tress, & Random Forest.

# Steps to be followed
1. DATA EXPLORATION
2. EDA
3. DATA PRE-PROCESSING
4. SPLITTING / FEATURE ENGINEERING 
5. OVERSAMPLING
6. MODEL BUILDING
7. MODEL ACCURACY
8. MODEL EVALUATION & SELECTION

# Techniques Used
- Binning (pre-processing)
- One Hot Encoding (Feature Engineering)
- SMOTE Technique (Oversampling)

# Conclusion
- Highest Accuracy Score :- Logistic Regression, SVM 
- Lowest Accuracy Score :- K Neighbors
